    "Due to the postulates of quantum mechanics, wavefunctions, $\\ket{\\psi}$, are written as linear combinations of basis states. \n",
    "While any basis is perfectly fine to use, we will pick one set of vectors, $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$, to be our basis. \n",
    "This basis is often referred to as the **computational basis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this basis, any state of the qubit can be represented in the following form:\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\psi} = \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1},$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are arbitrary complex numbers, $a + bi$.\n",
    "In this basis, we can simplify things and write the state as a vector:\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha \\\\ \\beta\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a key distinction between quantum and classical information. \n",
    "Classical bits, are restricted at any given time to existing in 1 of only 2 possible states:\n",
